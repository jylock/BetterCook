Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and continue simmering while preparing meatballs.",

Increase heat to medium and simmering until meatballs are no longer pink in the center, about 40 minutes, turning meatballs once about halfway through.",
        "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain. Serve meatballs and sauce over spaghetti with a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese."
